    <h1>Please read first!</h1>
    <p>In order to run our website, please navigate into the site/ directory and run the 'start.sh' bash script. This script both intialises the Mongo database connection, and starts the server. You may need to edit the Node.js command to either 'node' or 'nodejs' depending on your operating system. Then navigate to 'localhost:8081' to view our website. <br/>We excluded any node_modules and existing data to reduce our submission size. Use 'npm install' to install our dependencies, listed in package.json.</p>

    <h1>Server Side Report</h1>
    <p>On researching various server side techniques, we decided to use the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js) stack, which is a popular choice in modern industry due to its flexible simplicity and use of JavaScript throughout.
        <br/> This was our choice primarily for the use of Express and MongoDB, but we ended up using AngularJS for some client side work as well.</p>

    <h2> General </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We have implemented our web server in Express. Some of the features are as follows and they are described in more detail below:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    URL Validation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checking the URL is safe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Content negotiation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server side form input validation - including a spam catcher.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            We integrated MongoDB by using mongojs, which is a Node.js module that emulates the official Mongo API as much as possible. We use the following Mongo collections which are described in more detail below.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A comments section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Functionality for uploading images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A checkbox for 'tick to subscribe to emails' functionality.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Programming
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Neither of us had much prior experience with server side technologies, so this was a challenge at first, but after spending time studying the relevant documentation, we both gained a good understanding and put it to effective use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We used GitHub to work collaboratively and track our version history.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The homepage (index.html) and packages page (packages.html) views are served via the Express server, but have no additional server side functionality.</p>

    <h2>nutrition.html:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The comments section is intended for use by visitors to share recipes and their experiences of the site.
        </li>
        <li>
            On loading this page, a GET request is made to the server to retrieve all the comments in the 'commentlist' Mongo database. They are then displayed in a table attribute using the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat">'ng-repeat'</a> AngularJS directive.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the click of the post button, the AngularJS addComment() (in nutrition.js) function is called, which retrieves the name and comment from the HTML DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
            Both fields are checked: if they are invalid, empty, or the name is more than ten characters, a paragraph tag is updated to alert the user. In future we would add validation to prevent against profanities etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the fields are valid, the current time is appended to the object, and a /nutrition POST request is made to the server, where the comment is inserted into the 'commentlist' Mongo database. 
        </li>
        <li>
            On the response of this POST request, the aforementioned GET request is made again to update the page and display the new comment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>gallery.html:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We wanted users of the website to be able to upload photos of their meals and progress. This was one of the most time consuming elements of the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            On loading this page, a GET request is made to the server to retrieve all the image references in the 'imgrefs' Mongo database. The 'ng-repeat' Angular directive is again used to retrieve each reference in the database and display it in an image tag, resulting in a gallery of uploaded photos.
        </li>
        <li>
            On clicking the 'Upload Image' submit button, the form makes a POST request to the server to upload the file selected, using multipart/form-data. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://ewiggin.gitbooks.io/expressjs-middleware/content/multer.html">Multer Node.js middleware</a> is used for for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency and is used in server.js to upload each photo (first renaming it using the current date and time) to a local 'public/uploads/' directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            After being uploaded, the image path is inserted into a Mongo database, 'imgrefs'.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the response of the POST request, the activity of the server is currently slightly bugged. The JSON response opens a new window, and so one must re-navigate to the gallery page to view their uploaded image. This is being fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
            We are in the process of implementing the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate">'ng-animate'</a> AngularJS directive in order to make a sliding display of uploaded images. Unfortunately we have not been able to complete this by the deadline.
        </li>
        <li>
            We would additionally have liked to resize all uploaded images into a smaller format to save local space, as well as impose certain other limits on uploads. This is an improvement we would make in the future.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>contact.html:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The contact form enables a user to fill in fields on the website and have their message sent as an email to the business owner. There is also a checkbox for users to subscribe to future emails. From here the business owner could reply to each individual message and also send out marketing emails to all the users who ticked the box.
        </li>
        <li>
            On a click of the send button, the contact form calls a client side JavaScript function. This JavaScript function uses AJAX to make a send_mail POST request to the server which sends the form input as a JSON object. The server then validates the form input data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Firstly, there is a text field which is hidden with CSS. This means a user will never fill it in, however a spambot will find the input box and fill it in. If this box is filled in, the site has detetcted a spambot and will not send the email.
        </li>
        <li>
            If no spambot is detected, the server then checks that a user has filled in all of the necessary form fields, if they haven't then the email will not be sent and the server will send a response to the client 'Please fill in all fields!', which is then displayed on the form.
        </li>
        <li>
            If all fields are filled in, the server validates the email address using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator">email validator</a>. If this email address is not valid then the server will send a response to the client 'Email address invalid!', which is then displayed on the form.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the form is filled in properly, the server then checks if the 'tick to get future emails' box was checked. If it is, then the email address is added to the 'emaillist' Mongo database. The database is first checked to see if this email address has been entered before, and if so it is not added again (to avoid duplicate entries).
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, the server use <a href="https://nodemailer.com">Nodemailer</a> to send the email. To use Nodemailer, a reuseable transport object was previously created which establishes a connection with the SMTP server (GMail in our case) which can then be used to send the emails.
        </li>
    </ul>
