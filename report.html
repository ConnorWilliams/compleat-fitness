    <h1> Report for compleat-fitness </h1>


    <ul>
        <li>
            Lots of Google searches for almost everything involved with the site.
            Lots of useful demos found on Stack Overflow and W3 Schools which were
            taken and adapted for all sorts of features.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <h2> General </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            (Beautiful) Nav panel uses only HTML and CSS. This was first taken from
            <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JXGNGQ" target="_blank">a codepen demo</a> however they used FontAwesome for the
            icons. We adapted this so it uses custom made SVGs which were all made in Inkscape except for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/restaurant-cutlery-circular-symbol-of-a-spoon-and-a-fork-in-a-circle_45332">cutlery icon</a>
            The CSS has been extensively tied up and the styling and positioning changed.
            This took a long time to perfect but looks good now it's done.
        </li><li>
            Whole site has fluid design and everything is still readable no matter
            what size the window is made. Not tested on mobile.
        </li><li>
            'Compleat Fitness' logo and favicon created from scratch using Gimp and
            royalty-free font 'Pecita'.
        </li><li>
            Inclusion of a favicon.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2><a href="site/index.html#" target="_blank">index.html:</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Multiple different background images tried and tested against theme colours. Gimp was used to make copies with varying levels of opacity. The end result was mostly transparent (10% opacity), improving the legibility of overlying text.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2><a href="site/packages.html#" target="_blank">packages.html:</a></h2>

            Learned to write accordion from <a href="http://inspirationalpixels.com/tutorials/creating-an-accordion-with-html-css-jquery" target="_blank">inspirationalpixels</a>.
            Styled to our needs and work well for FAQs.
        </li><li>
            BMI Calculator uses JavaScript to take values from weight and height
            sliders, calculates BMI, and replaces the innerHTML of a DOM to display
            result. This happens on each change of sliders thanks to jQuery. Would like to add a Imperial/Metric toggle functionality if time after server side.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2><a href="site/nutrition.html#" target="_blank">nutrition.html:</a></h2>

        <li>
            Using <a href="https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js" target="_blank">Instafeed</a> to pull
            in pictures from Instagram was not too difficult, however we did have to
            set up an Instagram developer account and register the application. We think
            this plugin may be slightly broken in the respect that the pictures apparently cannot be resized. Connor is working on the plugin on his own branch on Github to try
            to reach a fix.
        </li><li>
            More difficult, managed to get the Instagram pictures in to a nice image
            slider <a href="https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/" target="_blank">Slick</a>. This now works well
            and will be more effective when the images are larger.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2><a href="site/contact.html#" target="_blank">contact.html:</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Contact form elements looked up on W3Schools and styling from different
            sources searching online to see what could look good on our site.
        </li><li>
            Google map instructions taken from the Google Map API intro page.
