            Many Google searches have been made to try and find resources on almost everything involved with the site. Lots of useful demos were found on Stack Overflow and W3 Schools which we have taken and adapted for most of our features. All HTML pages are valid HTML 5 Polyglot.

            Navigation bar uses only HTML and some advanced CSS. This was first taken from <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JXGNGQ" target="_blank">a codepen demo</a>, however it originally used FontAwesome for the icons. This has been adapted so it now uses custom made SVGs which were all made in Inkscape. The only exception being the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/restaurant-cutlery-circular-symbol-of-a-spoon-and-a-fork-in-a-circle_45332">cutlery icon</a>. The CSS for the nav bar now looks much tidier and the styling such as colours and positioning has been changed. This nav bar took a long time and a lot of work to perfect, but it looks good now it's done.

            The whole site has fluid design, remaining completely useable no matter what window size it is being viewed in. We have not however tested the site on mobile.

            Multiple different background images tried and tested against theme colours. Gimp was used to make copies with varying levels of opacity. The end result was mostly transparent (10% opacity), improving the legibility of overlying text.

            BMI Calculator uses JavaScript to take values from weight and height
            sliders, calculates BMI, and replaces the innerHTML of a DOM to display
            result. This happens on each change of sliders thanks to jQuery. Would like to add a Imperial/Metric toggle functionality if time after server side.

            <a href="https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js" target="_blank">Instafeed</a> is used to add pictures from Instagram using only javascript. An Instagram developer account was needed to register the application before pictures could be accessed.
        </li><li>
            A more difficult task was to put the Instagram pictures in to a nice image slider called <a href="https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/" target="_blank">Slick</a>. This now works well and looks nice since the images are larger and scroll automatically.
